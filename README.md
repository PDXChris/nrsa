R package for calculating habitat metrics from the National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) protocol.  This package started as a large group of scripts written by folks at the US EPA NHEERL Western Ecology Division for the 2009 National Rivers and Streams Survey.  However, the scripts were not intended to be used outside of an EPA specific environment without making extensive changes.  I reworked the meat of the scripts into functions that could be used to build metric calculation scripts for data collected using the NRSA wadeable and non-wadeable protocols.  I attempted to make the code more modular so that code maintenance and improvement were easier.
